# README Generator

This README Generator creates a readme by prompting the user to answer several questions and generate a document from the inputted answers.

The user will be asked for:

* GitHub username

* Name of the project

* Description of the project

* License

* Installation command

* Usage

* Contributors

* Test command


From this input of this information, the user will have a README.md file generated with the contents of the answers they've inputted. The document will also include the user's GitHub profile picture and a link to their GitHub account.
